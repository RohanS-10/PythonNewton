# Newton's Method Convergence

This Python script demonstrates the convergence of Newton's method for finding roots of functions. The user is prompted to choose between a cubic function and a quadratic function. If an invalid choice is made, it defaults to the cubic function.

## Functions Available:

### 1. Cubic Function
   - Function: \(f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6\)
   - Derivative: \(f'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 11\)

### 2. Quadratic Function
   - Function: \(f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 4\)
   - Derivative: \(f'(x) = 2x - 4\)

## How to use:
1. Run the script.
2. Choose the desired function by entering the corresponding number.
3. Enter an initial guess for the root.

The script will display a plot showing the convergence of Newton's method, highlighting the root in red.

## Requirements:
- Python 3
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
